opsview_client Cookbook
=======================
This cookbook:
- Installs the Opsview client
- Sets-up repositories (Linux)
- Installs Opsview agent 
- Ensure Opsview agent service is enabled and started
- Optionally registers the client with the server (TODO)

Note: you can setup your own repoistory settings using the provider settings, see `resources/client.rb`. 

# Requirements
- Chef 12.5+

## Usage
This cookbook provides custom resources using `opsview_client` & `opsview_rest_client`, include these in your own recipe as you would do with a template or directory resource

#### `opsview_client`

## Windows Example
```ruby
opsview_client 'bob' do
  allowed_hosts '192.168.0.200'
  nsca_host '192.168.0.1'
  nsca_port '5667'
end
```

## Linux Example
```ruby
opsview_client 'bob' do
  allowed_hosts '192.1680.200'
  include_epel true
  repository_key 'super-long-key-from-opsview'
end
```

If you wish to add extra config for NRPE, add your file to the following places: 
- Linux: `/usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe_local`
- Windows: `C:\Program Files\Opsview Agent\custom.ini`

## Testing
When testing Linux, set the environment variable `OPSVIEW_REPO_KEY` to your licence key obtained from opsview
